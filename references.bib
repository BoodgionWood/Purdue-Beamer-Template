abstract = {The proliferation of large data sets and Bayesian inference techniques motivates demand for better data sparsification. Coresets provide a principled way of summarizing a large dataset via a smaller one that is guaranteed to match the performance of the full data set on specific problems. Classical coresets, however, neglect the underlying data distribution, which is often continuous. We address this oversight by introducing Wasserstein measure coresets, an extension of coresets which by definition takes into account generalization. Our formulation of the problem, which essentially consists in minimizing the Wasserstein distance, is solvable via stochastic gradient descent. This yields an algorithm which simply requires sample access to the data distribution and is able to handle large data streams in an online manner. We validate our construction for inference and clustering.},
